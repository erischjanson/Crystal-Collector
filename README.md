# week-4-game
Jquery app

Crystals Collector

Description:

This app uses jQuery to create a simple game of "match that number". 

A random number will be displayed along with images of precious gems. Each gem is assigned a random value, which is hidden from the user. Each time the user clicks on a gem, their total scored will increment by the value of the clicked gem. The user's goal is to match their total score to the random number initially displayed by the app. If the number is matched exactly, the user earns a "win". If the user overshoots the number, they earn a "loss". Total wins and losses are displayed in real time.
